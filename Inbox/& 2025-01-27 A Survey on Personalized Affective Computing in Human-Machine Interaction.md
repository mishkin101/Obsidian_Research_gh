> abstract:: In computing, the aim of personalization is to train a model that caters to a specific individual or group of people by optimizing one or more performance metrics and adhering to specific constraints. In this paper, we discuss the need for personalization in affective and personality computing (hereinafter referred to as affective computing). We present a survey of state-of-the-art approaches for personalization in affective computing. Our review spans training techniques and objectives towards the personalization of affective computing models. We group existing approaches into seven categories: (1) Target-specific Models, (2) Group-specific Models, (3) Weighting-based Approaches, (4) Fine-tuning Approaches, (5) Multitask Learning, (6) Generative-based Models, and (7) Feature Augmentation. Additionally, we provide a statistical meta-analysis of the surveyed literature, analyzing the prevalence of different affective computing tasks, interaction modes, interaction contexts, and the level of personalization among the surveyed works. Based on that, we provide a road-map for those who are interested in exploring this direction.
