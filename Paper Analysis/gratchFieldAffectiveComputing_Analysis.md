##  <h1 class="color-yellow">Technical Details</h>
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"affective computing is a broad and vibrant field that not only recognizes affective states, but attempts to model and predict affective responses, and uses these models to generate life-like robots and digital characters, as well as to shape how people make decisions."</mark>  [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TTKU7KFE?page=&annotation=RHHBXLWI) #interpretation

	- Interpretation of affective computing. Difference between affective state and affective response? how is it different from an emotional state or response? #interpretation
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"emerging consensus in emotion research is that these components are only loosely connected."</mark>  [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TTKU7KFE?page=2&annotation=CA5KY58N) #Emotion, #Interpretation
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"emotion in particular has been argued to be best described by basic emotion categories"</mark>  [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TTKU7KFE?page=2&annotation=5AQZAUF7) #affective-theory
